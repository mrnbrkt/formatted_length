= FormattedLength

Project uses MIT-LICENSE. 
For classes that acts_as_formatted_length, it adds instance function formatted_length, that converts lenght represented in seconds to a string.
For instance:
0 => 00:00
10 => 00:10
70 => 01:10
3666 => 1:01:06

The integer field defaults to :length, but can be altered by acts_as_formatted_length, :field => YOUR_FIELD_GOES_HERE
